\section{Statement}

The Rubin Observatory Construction Project has no remit to provide services or systems capable of supporting access by non-data-rights holders to data products after the two year proprietary period has elapsed.
That said, we do not regard doing so as an insurmountable task.
In particular:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Data access services being developed during the construction era are designed to be capable of meeting any plausible public demand for access given appropriate hardware and network resources;}
  \item{Major commercial cloud vendors have a track record of hosting public datasets for free, and have expressed interest and willingness to engage with the Project on this topic;}
  \item{In-kind contributions may include capacity for making data available to the public;}
  \item{An ``object-lite'' catalog, containing only the most generally valuable columns provided by the full Object table, is sufficiently compact to be delivered via a content delivery network (as was done for the Gaia catalog).}

\end{itemize}

It is worth noting that this matter will not arise until the end of the third year of the survey; planning for deploying the above resources is therefore a question for the Operations Team.
Further discussions on various ways of serving parts or all of the data are discussed in \citeds{LPM-251}.
